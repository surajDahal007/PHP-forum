                    Our mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge.
                    Not all knowledge can be written down, but much of that which can be,
                    still isn't. It remains in people’s heads or only accessible if
                    you know the right people.

                    <h2>Gather around a question</h2>
                    <p>The heart of iDiscuss is questions — questions that affect
                        the world, questions that explain recent world events,
                        questions that guide important life decisions, and questions
                        that provide insights into why other people think differently.
                        iDiscuss is a place where you can ask questions that matter to you
                        and get answers from people who have been there and done that.
                        iDiscuss is where scientists, developers, students and entrepreneurs,
                        take refuge from misinformation and incendiary
                        arguments to share what they know.</p>

                    <p>
                        Ever since the first humans gathered around a fire and turned
                        their gaze to the stars, humanity has shared knowledge through
                        stories. Spaces are digital campfires for collective meaning
                        making which expand knowledge sharing from interrogative to
                        narrative. In Spaces, creators build audiences of millions for
                        their unique insights or audiences of thousands for niche
                        knowledge that can't be found anywhere else.
